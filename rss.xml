            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Man Beats Friend To Death After Binge-Watching The Walking Dead</h1><p>Hearing about a guy killing his friend over The Walking Dead might make you think it was a reaction to Sunday night's episode, which featured one of the show's craziest moments.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to create horror sound effects that are truly scary (and gory!) | A Sound Effect</h1><p>I think every sound designer should do his own gore and splatter sound fx at least once in his/her career. It's not as if there weren't many great sounding, positively disgusting Gore Sound Effects libraries but it's so much fun that I would do it just for fun in my free time.</p><img src="http://www.asoundeffect.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/horror_and_gore_sound_effects.jpg"></article>]]></description>
